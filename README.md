## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind

### What I learned

[useOutsideClick](https://blog.logrocket.com/detect-click-outside-react-component-how-to/) is useful but I couldn't make
it bubble the event for some reason.

### Continued development

I'd want to make useOutsideClick viable, as that would make for a good design pattern
